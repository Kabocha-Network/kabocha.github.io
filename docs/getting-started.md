## What is Kabocha?

Kabocha is parachain candidate on Kusama and an instance of Network Publics that enables sovereign network legos for humanity. 

Kabocha is a decentralised government that is spawned by Edgeware and will spawn new multichain networks. 

It will act as a parabridge to both Edgeware and future relay "network publics".
