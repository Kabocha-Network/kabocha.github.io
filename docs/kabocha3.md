title: RMRK 3.0
---

RMRK 3.0 is a full rewrite of RMRK logic using smart contracts (Solidity) for inclusion in EVM
chains like Moonriver, and FRAME Pallets ([Substrate](https://substrate.dev), Rust) for inclusion in
chains' native runtimes.

The release is planned for Q1 2022 with MVPs becoming available for testing earlier.
